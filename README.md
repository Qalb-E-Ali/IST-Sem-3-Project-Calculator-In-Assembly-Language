# IST-Sem-3-Project-Calculator-In-Assembly-Language
In our 3rd semester we created a calculator using assembly language for our course computer organization &amp; assembly language. The calculator features basic mathematical operations.

We have designed the calculator in assembly language and used the following 13 functions:
1) Addition of two numbers          
2) Subtraction of two numbers          
3) Division of two numbers            
4) Multiplication of two numbers                    
5) Factorial a Number            
6) Computing power of any number       
Following formulas have been used:
7) a+b/2                         
8) (a + b)^2    
9) (a + b)^3 
10) (a - b)^3 
11) a^1 + b^2 + c^3 + d^4        
12) (a^3 + b^3) 
13) (a^3 - b^3)
